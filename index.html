            INDIA HAS GOT A RICH CULTURAL HERITAGE OF “UNITY IN DIVERSITY”, THE
            ROOTS OF WHICH ARE INEXTRICABLY FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF
            “VASUDHAIV KUTUMBAKAM”, MEANING THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A
            FAMILY. AT THE TIME OF INDIA’S INDEPENDENCE IN 1947, IT WAS HOWEVER
            DIVIDED INTO MORE THAN 560 PRINCELY STATES AND IT WAS INDIA’S FIRST
            DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, BHARAT RATNA SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL, WHO
            WITH HIS FIRM DETERMINATION, COULD TRANSFORM SUCH IMPERIALISM INTO
            TODAY’S UNIFIED INDIA. PEOPLE OF INDIA WILL REMAIN INDEBTED TO HIM
            FOREVER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP DURING THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE AND HIS
            VISION, WISDOM AND STATESMANSHIP IN THE POST-INDEPENDENCE ERA. HIS
            LIFE IS AN ETERNAL SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR THE PRESENT AS WELL AS
            FUTURE GENERATIONS AND IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT HIS ICONIC
            MONUMENTAL STATUE – THE WORLD’S TALLEST STATUE OF UNITY HAS BEEN
            DEDICATED TO THE NATION ON THE 143RD BIRTH ANNIVERSARY. SYMBOLIZING
            THE NATIONAL, SPIRITUAL, HISTORICAL AND ACADEMIC VALUES, THE STATUE
            OF UNITY WILL LEAD TO THE ICON-BASED DEVELOPMENT OF THIS ENTIRE
            REGION, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY A TRIBAL AREA. OUR VISION IS TO MAKE
            THIS PLACE A WORLD CLASS TOURIST DESTINATION BY PROVIDING
            INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EDUTAINMENT, RESEARCH, CULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL
            ENRICHMENT AND HEALTH PROMOTION. A TRUE LEADER KEEPS ON ENLIGHTENING
            THE PATH OF MANKIND EVEN IN HIS PHYSICAL ABSENCE AND THE STATUE OF
            UNITY IS THE REALIZATION OF THIS – WORTH EXPERIENCING.

      <h1>A TESTIMONIAL OF INDIA'S SPIRIT OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY</h1>

        <p>
          Since time immemorial, architecture and monuments have given India her
          identity. From historical Ajanta & Ellora caves to Delwara Temple of
          Mount Abu and from Taj Mahal to Meenakshi Temple of Madurai, Indian
          architecture showcases its elegance and superiority across the globe.
          The most prolific creation in recent times, the Statue of Unity, is
          the World’s Tallest Monument. It represents more than a colossal
          structure facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the river Narmada. It is an
          iconic symbol of the ‘Iron Man’, who played an important role during
          India’s freedom struggle and thereafter in the unification of the
          princely states. It reminds the world of the towering personality of
          Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the nucleus of India’s integration as a
          united country. It was the wit and whip of this ‘Iron Man’ that 562
          small and big princely states unanimously agreed to become an integral
          part of India. The elucidation of the Statue directly correlates with
          the meaning and value of unity. While, it is one of the finest
          interpretations of the designers with its modern construal, it also
          symbolises and describes the quintessence of the statue to visitors.
          The world’s tallest statue is an engineering marvel that was
          constructed in merely 46 months. Sardar Patel, respected for his
          commitment and drive, took up the challenge of convincing all the
          princely states using diplomacy and peaceful means, or the iron hand
          when needed. The impressive landmark commemorating Sardar Patel’s
          contribution to unification dovetails into several social development
          programmes such as improved transport and connectivity, institutions
          of research, education and tribal development, tourist facilities and
          other social infrastructure.
